<h1 class="title">The fabulous rubycorns</h1>

<h2>Who?</h2>
<p>We are a study group meeting on Tuesdays to learn ruby, rails and other things programming.</p>
<p>Right now people with various skill levels meet and work on things related to code. If you're a person who identifies as a woman, you're welcome to come by and work on things as well.</p>

<h2>What?</h2>
<p>We maintain and constantly try to improve <a href="http://rorganize.it/" title="Rorganize.it">rorganize.it</a> an app for learners to find groups, coaches and other learners. Check <a href="https://github.com/rubycorns/rorganize.it" title="Rorganize.it on GitHub">the code on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>We also started <a href="http://juniorsareawesome.org/" title="JuniorsAreAwesome">JuniorsAreAwesome</a> (which is no longer active at this point) and <a href="https://github.com/rubycorns/whatdojuniorsgetpaid" title="whatdojuniorsgetpaid on GitHub">whatdojuniorsgetpaid</a> (which is not yet active at this point). Check them out anyway!</p>
<p>There are also other learning materials provided by our fellow study group the <a href="http://rubymonstas.org/">RubyMonstas</a> and other tutorials.</p>

<p>No Ruby? No problem! We also hack on JavaScript, Elixir and ops things. Or anything really.</p>
